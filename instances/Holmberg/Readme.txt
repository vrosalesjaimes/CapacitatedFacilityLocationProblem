These data files are set Holmberg in Guastaroba G. and Speranza M.G. A Heuristic for BILP Problems: The Single Source Capacitated Facility Location Problem, currently under review in the European Journal of Operational Research.

These instances have been introduced in Holmberg, K., R{\"o}nnqvist, M. and Yuan, D., ``An Exact Algorithm for the Capacitated Facility Location Problems with Single Sourcing'', European Journal of Operational Research, 113(3), 1999, 544--559.

There are currently 71 data files. The format of these data files is:

|J| |I|
s_1 f_1
s_2 f_2
  ...
s_|J| f_|J|
d_1 d_2 d_3 … d_|I|
c_{11} c_{12} c_{13} … c_{1|I|} 
c_{21} c_{22} c_{23} … c_{2|I|} 
   ...    ...    ...   ....
c_{|J|1} c_{|J|2} c_{|J|3} … c_{|J||I|} 

where:

|J| is the number of potential facility locations;
|I| is the number of customers;
s_j (j=1,...,|J|) is the capacity of facility j;
f_j (j=1,...,|J|) is the fixed cost of opening facility j;
d_i (i=1,...,|I|) is the demand of customer i;
c_{ji} (j=1,...,|J|), (i=1,...,|I|) is the cost of allocating all the demand of customer i to facility j.

Further details on these instances are provided in the paper mentioned above.
